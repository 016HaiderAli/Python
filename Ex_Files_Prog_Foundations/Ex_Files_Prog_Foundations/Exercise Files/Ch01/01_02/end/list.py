# Office locations
# city1 = 'Tokyo'
# city2 = 'Dakar'
# city3 = 'Mumbai'
# city4 = 'Buenos Aires'

# now to simply the code, we defined the collection of these cities in a variable called 'cities' in a structure called list
cities = [
    'Tokyo',
    'Dakar',
    'Mumbai',
    'Buenos Aires',
]

# now let's see what does the cities variables contains
print(cities)
